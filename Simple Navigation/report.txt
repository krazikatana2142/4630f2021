I originally planned for this app to be a Map Application that would immediately show a path for the user to follow for whereever they want to go. However, due to technical problems, the app now consists of a list of locations that the user may want to go. The user may select one of these locations and it will redirect them to a map showing that location(s). The user may also chose to add locations to the list and save them for later (saving locations currently crashes the app).
