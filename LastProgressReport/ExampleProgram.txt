This is the link to the Github to the prewritten code I am using to edit and learn how to use Google Maps SDK.
The zip file itself is too large to put on Github, so I linked the original code written by Alberto Peam
The code I edited hasn't changed very much and I am using this code to learn and implement in my own app
